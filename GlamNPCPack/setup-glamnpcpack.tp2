SAY DESC ~28 Hammer, 1358:
On my mother's grave, I will kill every hippogriff I see to the end of my life. Stinking beasts stomped my Thundercat into the dirt. Even now, with her wounds treated, she won't wake up. The healer says he doesn't know if she will. I wave sardines beneath her nose, I poke her in the belly, for which she has never before failed to punish me, even from the deepest slumber, and yet still she lies unaware on her pillow, quiet as death.

You pull through, you old hag. Don't leave me alone in this wretched world.


4 Alturiak, 1358:
Thundercat is awake and alert, but not whole. I am told the injuries to her head were too severe to mend fully, and now she mews and growls where once she spoke as eruditely as I.

It pains her. I can see it. She hides it well, as she hides everything besides her ire, but I've had her at my side too long to be fooled. She has not forgotten herself, what she used to be. She knows what is gone.

I've never felt such unbearable helplessness! I had every blasted medic in the regiment up by their collars, demanding solutions, finding none. There is magic to heal even the deepest afflictions, they say, but none of the sort I can afford.

Perhaps, instead, it could be earned.


25 Ches, 1358:
Rejected. Rejected everywhere. Tempus spurns me for favouring spellbook over sword, while the Lady of Strategy tuts at my impatience. Chauntea resents that I will not value plants as people, and Eldath will have no-one who clings to the trappings of war. For Sune, too dour, for Torm, too rebellious, for Ilmater, too selfish. Tell me, what is selfish in the wish to heal a friend? I will ask them such when next I visit. Bastards.


1 Tarsakh, 1358:
The Ilmatari shrine is destroyed! I returned to present my case anew and found only rubble and corpses, and the telltale black streaks of magical electric discharge. A scene of terrible carnage.

And yet, I find myself unmoved; even, dare I say, gratified to witness their smug piety torn down and left in ruins. Perhaps a dose of healthy self-interest would have seen them with more than wooden staffs and begging bowls to defend themselves from whomever did this.

There is a trail here.


5 Tarsakh, 1358:
My hunt led to a cavern in the mountains, and to a woman dressed in steel and leather, who wore a silver bolt of lightning around her neck. She attacked the moment she saw me, perhaps assuming I had come to pay justice for Ilmater's fallen, but a captain of the War Wizards is no easy foe.

We fought to a stalemate, until we both lay drained and breathless on the cold stone. Only then did she ask my name and my purpose. I said that I sought the destroyer of the Ilmatari shrine, and she told me I had found her. I said that I commended her thoroughness, and she laughed a longer laugh than I have ever heard. Thus, our acquaintance made, we set our weapons aside and settled by the fire to recuperate.

She tells me she knows a thing or two of divine power, and of a short path to walk for those who seek it, and I know from our battle that she speaks true.

I have followed the trail this far. Let us see what waits at the end of it.~
